    <div class="about">
    <p>
    Pankh (Foundation) was started in 2008 with an aim to bring a positive change in society. Initially,
    the Foundation worked only on donation activities through funds collected from well-wishers and pooled in from
    the founders. However, the founders of Pankh soon realized that this would have a limited impact and something
    more sustainable needed to be done to empower the women to earn a livelihood so that they do not depend on donations.
    In 2014 Pankh Handicrafts was started with an aim to provide a platform to rural women for a sustainable source of
    income. Not just the women, their kids and families also became a part of the cheerful and warm environs of
    Pankh where they learnt life skills from volunteers who spent time teaching them after their school hours.
